#### (Attention: This card is in Beta)

This card allows besides opening, closing or setting a shutter to the opening rate you want, also many options to design your shutter by combining sizes and images you want.

It is a follow-up of [Deejayfool/Shuttercard](https://github.com/Deejayfool/hass-shutter-card), a nice Card for Shutters.
I started with a simple change for the motion of the shutters, but soon it became a huge update.
Due to the inactivity of the Shutter Card, I decided to add this one as 'Enhanced Shutter Card' to HACS.

It supports all options of the original Card, but also graphical options like different backrounds, windows an shutters.
Also the sizes of every shutter can be altered:

(_find below the yaml for this example._)

By default the card has 3 colored windows and shutter images, ands two background views in the package:

| color | window-image | shutter-slat image | shutter-bottom-bar image | default
| -| - | - | - | -
| grey | esc-window.png   | esc-shutter-slat.png  | esc-shutter-bottom.png | yes
| brown | esc-window2.png | esc-shutter-slat2.png | esc-shutter-bottom2.png | no
| green | esc-window3.png | esc-shutter-slat3.png | esc-shutter-bottom3.png | no
| grey | esc-window.png   | esc-shutter-slat.png  | esc-shutter-bottom.png | yes
| brown | esc-window2.png | esc-shutter-slat2.png | esc-shutter-bottom2.png | no
| green | esc-window3.png | esc-shutter-slat3.png | esc-shutter-bottom3.png | no

These are the avialable background views:

| view filename | default
|-|-
| esc-view.png | yes
| esc-view2.png | no

These filimages can be combined like in the example above. For the location of the images a setting 'image_map" does exits.
The default map-setting can be found in the Configuration-info below.
It is also possible to enter a full path in the imagename itself. When a '/' is found in the image-name, the image-name is condiderd to include a full path.

## Install

Use HACS, search for Enhancd Shutter Card, the resources will automatically be configured with the needed files.

As long as this card is not a default one in HACS (PR is awaiting aproval), you need to add this repository as a Custom Repository.
See for installing Custom Repositories this [hacs-custom-repositories](https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories/) page.
